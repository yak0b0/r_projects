## Introduction

The dataset that I will be taking a look at contains detailed statistics about NCAA basketball teams, from the years 2013 - 2025 (excluding 2020, when COVID-19 restricted postseason play).

I will be trying to find patterns, that might occur in winning/losing teams (identifying those teams), detecting anomalies (teams that have absurdly high/low stats in certain cafeterias) and overall looking in depth at this dataset.

I found my dataset on kaggle.com, you can also access it via this link:

## Loading in our dataset + adding packages in R

I downloaded the dataset as a compressed zip from kaggle and then extracted `cbb.csv` which contains combined data from all 11 seasons.

```{r} 
data <- read.csv("cbb.csv")
```

I then decided to load in all packages that I will use during this EDA. (For now just tidyverse)

```{r}
#| label: packages
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Look at the data and clean it
